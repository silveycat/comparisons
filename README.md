This repository contains:

1) `main analyses.R` - an R script that reproduces the statistical analyses and plots reported in the paper
2) in the `data` folder, de-identified data files read in by this script to generate the plots and analyses. `aim3_imputed.txt` contains the specific imputed datasets analysed in the paper, but the script also includes the code for generating new imputed datasets.

To run the analyses and generate the plots, open `main analyses.R` in R, set the working directory to the location of the file, and ensure the `data` folder is in the same directory.
